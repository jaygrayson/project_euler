# project_euler

My work through Project Euler problems, for now all in Python 2.7. My main reference as I brush up on python is <https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures>.

Problems are 'finished' if run time is less than 60 seconds. Run times are noted in commit comments if longer than 1 second.
